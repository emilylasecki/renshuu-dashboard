# renshuu dashboard

This project utilizes renshuu.org's API to get user's Japanese vocab, kanji, sentences, and grammar reviews for the given day. It also compiles studied terms from the Japanese Language Proficiency Test, or JLPT, to display overall Japanese progress on a visually pleasing graph. The program is bundled into an executable file and can also be run from the command line, so developers and non-developers alike can both make use of renshuu dashboard!

After entering your API key, a .txt file will be generated in the directory for your user that renshuu dashboard can update and store. Re-running the program will read from this file and allow a similar view to the following to appear. From the API call, your renshuu Kaochan will populate on the frame, today's terms will be counted on the frame, and you'll unlock the toggle feature in the lower right corner to view your progress graph.
